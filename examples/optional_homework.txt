Exercise 1
Create a ruby application that asks a player to guess a number between 1 an 10.
Give the player three guesses and tell them if they need to guess higher or lower each time.
If they get it right, congratulate them. If they lose, tell them the number.

google "ruby random number"
number_of_guesses = 3
